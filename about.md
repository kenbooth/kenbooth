### About
I'm a journalist turned merchant.

Co-founder of Shorpy, Inc., an e-commerce business that sells and licenses historical images. [Shorpy](https://shorpy.com) has an extensive archive of  photographs and an active online community that explores the rich stories behind each image.

More than 25 years of experience running online services, including as editor-in-chief of online news for 6 newspapers, and helping manage the launch of *The Orlando Sentinel* on the Web. Before that I worked as a copy editor and page designer at *The Orlando Sentinel*.

I spend my work days generating SEO-driven copy, handling fiscal duties and managing customer service.

A proud graduate of Auburn University's MBA program and the University of Florida's School of Journalism.
