After looking at multiple recipes for ginger simple syrup, I have developed and tested the consensus best recipe and included a recipe for a ginger old fashioned below.

### Ginger simple syrup

* 1 cup sugar
* 1 cup water
* 1/2 to 3/4 cup peeled and thinly sliced ginger

Bring the ginger, sugar, and water to a boil over medium-low heat. Stir until sugar has dissolved. Reduce to simmer and remove from heat. Steep covered for 30 minutes. Double strain the syrup through a fine mesh into an airtight container. Discard ginger and store syrup for up to a month in the refrigerator.

### Ginger old fashioned
* 2 oz rye whiskey
* 2 dashes orange bitters
* 2 maraschino cherries

Add simple syrup, bitters and maraschino cherries to cocktail glass and lightly muddle cherries. Add a few cubes of ice and stir about 30 seconds or until cold. Top glass with ice and enjoy.

*Note: The fruitiness of the cherries pairs well with the spiciness of the ginger syrup. For a step up use Luxardo cherries.*

(Update: I used this throughout the 2021 holiday season and it was a hit. Because it has fresh ginger in it, there is a bit of a kick to it.)
