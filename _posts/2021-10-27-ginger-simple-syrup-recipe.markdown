After looking at multiple recipes for ginger simple syrup, I have compiled the consensus best practices and recipe.

* 1 cup sugar
* 1 cup water
* 1/2 to 3/4 cup peeled and thinly sliced ginger

Bring the ginger, sugar, and water to a boil over medium-low heat. Stir until sugar has dissolved. Reduce to simmer and remove from heat. Steep covered for 30 minutes. Double strain the syrup through a fine mesh into an airtight container. Discard ginger and store syrup for up to a month in the refrigerator.

(Update: I used this throughout the 2021 holiday season and it was a hit. Because it has fresh ginger in it, there is a bit of a kick to it.)
